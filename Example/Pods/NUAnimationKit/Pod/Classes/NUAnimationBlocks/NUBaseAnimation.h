 By default, no action is taken when the animation is cancelled.
 If you need to reliably get to a state after you trigger animations, even if they are cancelled,
 you should supply your @c animationBlock here.

 Animations can be prematurelly terminated by iOS's Core Animation framework when a UIView is no longer visible.
 In that case, you may need to do some final adjustments to your internal view's state,
